# Welcome to My Ethereum Mempool and MEV Landscape Repository

## Introduction

Hi all, welcome to my repo! The purpose of this repository is purely educational and serves as a way to track my learning progress. Here, you will find a collection of tools and resources that will help you gain a better understanding of the Ethereum mempool and MEV landscape, with a particular focus on alt-mempool (EIP-4337).

## Tools and Resources

### Bundler

**Bundler:** This tool provides a quick technical explanation for bundling multiple transactions. It aims to give you insights into how transactions are grouped together and submitted to the Ethereum network efficiently.

### Decoder

**Decoder:** This tool offers a technical explanation for decoding transaction data. It helps you understand the contents of a transaction and how to interpret the data within it.

### Reader

**Reader:** A simple mempool reader that demonstrates how to filter transactions. This tool allows you to monitor the mempool and selectively focus on transactions of interest.

### Sims

**Sims:** This section provides a walkthrough of what a simulation looks like for the major DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges). It helps you visualize and understand the process and outcomes of transaction simulations.

## Inspiration and Credit

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the amazing people and resources that have been instrumental in my understanding of the Ethereum mempool and MEV landscape. Your contributions have been invaluable. So, thank you! Please check them out as all props go to them.
